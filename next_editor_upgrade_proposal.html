    <h1>NeXT editor upgrade proposal</h1>
    <p>When I have some time, I'll upgrade the NeXT editor which is frozen since Summer 1991. See the current bug list and do the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>URGENT: preserve links to FTP servers when saving relatively to a file: prefix (i.e. always ! Very dangerous, cf Gutenberg).</li>
        <li>Add an option to save the document with absolute addresses (such documents may then be sent out of context, e.g. home pages). References to anchors in the same document should remain relative.</li>
        <li>CRUCIAL: Offer to save edited documents when quitting !!!</li>
        <li>Add a Document/Update menu entry to force re-reading of the latest version (or re-running the query).</li>
        <li>Implement Undo (at least one level !)</li>
        <li>Implement Find panel etc.</li>
        <li>Cut and paste anchors...</li>
        <li>Offer to customize anchor rendering (esp. with color).</li>
        <li>Get the window wide enough (or reduce the left margin) when reading plain text.</li>
        <li>Don't add spaces after anchors and glossary titles when saving.</li>
        <li>Make the generated HTML more human-readable (skip lines, etc.)</li>
        <li>Make the HTML proper SGML by Dan's DTD. Especially, quote all attributes including non-alpha characters.</li>
        <li>Don't screw up the HTML when an anchor is created at the end of the file (typically linking the author's name).</li>
        <li>Give the HTML icon to iconized windows.</li>
        <li>Display the index search within the document window.</li>
        <li>In the Cmd-O panel, display the current document address in one field and give another field to type in the destination, which can be interpreted relatively to the current address.</li>
        <li>Add a menu item to directly link the selection to a given UDI, perhaps taken from the pasteboard (saves doing Cmd-O first, then Cmd-A, then find the source document again, then Cmd-L). See also Viola's `Use Selected' feature.</li>
        <li>When pasting plain text, apply the current paragraph style</li>
        <li>Says Tim: All these things are interlinked -- the thing it needs is a part of the library which deals with regenerating HTML from a sequence of styles, and THAT would be useful for gateways, caching documents, all kinds of things.</li>
        <li>Make sure that newly opened windows are not too long for the screen. This happens when a document is just short enough not to need a scrollbar, but the window is not opened at the top of the screen.</li>
    </ul>
