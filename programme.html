    <h1>Programme</h1>
    <p>This is a summary of the <a href="introduction_ECHT90.html" target="_self">ECHT90</a> conference program. The conference consisted of a day of <a href="#tutorials">tutorial</a> sessions, then two days of <a href="#paper_sessions">paper</a> presentations with parallel track of <a href="#panel_sessions">panel</a> sessions and an <a href="exhibition.html" target="_self">exhibition</a> of products and posters. The content of most of these are are available in the proceedings, which were distributed in paper book form at registration time (the proceedings include the question/answers of the panel sessions, surely a world first!). The working language was English. The term Hypertext should now certainly be replaced by hypermedia: all products I <a href="authors.html" target="_self">(RC)</a> saw that were remotely interesting included not only text and graphics, but also the possibility of animation (eg. video) and sound (eg. voice). The overall attendence was around 450.</p>

    <h2 id="panel_sessions">Panel Sessions</h2>
    
        <p>The panel sessions were held in a smaller room than the papers, with a panel of 3 to 5 people entertaining an audience which varied between 50 and 300. The sessions each started with a (short) presentation by each of the panellists, after which the floor was opened for discussion. The panels were nominally on the following subjects:-</p>

        <ul>
            <li>What should hypermedia authoring systems for computer aided instruction look like?</li>
