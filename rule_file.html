    <h1>The Rule File</h1>

    <p>The rule file defines how the server will translate a request into an actual filename. It allows one to provide an extra level of name mapping above that given by links in the file system. It allows, for example, out of date names to mapped onto their more recent counterparts.</p>
    <p>The rule file also allows access to be restricted. This is essential, to prevent, for example, unauthorized access to your password file.</p>
    <p>By default, the rule file /etc/httpd.conf is loaded, unless specified otherwise with the -R or -r <a href="daemon_command_line.html">options</a> .</p>
    <p><a href="rule_file_examples.html">See example rule files</a> .</p>

    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>[The format changed for version 0.2] Each line consists of an operation code and one or two parameters, referred to as the template and the result. Anything on a line after and including a hash sign (#) is ignored, as are empty lines.</p>
    <p>The operation codes are as follows</p>

    <dt>map template result</dt>
    <dd>If the address matches the template, use the result string from now on for future rules.</dd>

    <dt>pass template</dt>
    <dd>If the address maches the template, use it as it is, porocessing no further rules.</dd>

    <dt>fail template</dt>
    <dd>If the address matches the template, prohibit access, processing no futher rules.</dd>

    <p>The template string may contain at most one wildcard asterisk ("*"). The result string may have one wildcard only if the template has one.</p>

    <p>When matching,</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Rules are scanned from the top of the file to the bottom.</li>
        <li>If a request matches a "map" template exactly, the result string is used from then on.</li>
        <li>If the request maches a "map" template with wildcard, then the text of the request which matches the wildcard is inserted in place of the wildcard in the result string to form the translated request. If the result string has no wildcard, it is used as it is.</li>
        <li>When a substitution takes place, the rule scan continues with the next rule using the new string in place of the request.</li>
    </ul>
