    <h1>Priviliged ports</h1>

    <p>The TCP/IP port numbers below 1024 are special in that normal users are not allowed to run servers on them. This is a security feaure, in that if you connect to a service on one of these ports you are fairly sure that you have the real thing, and not a fake which some hacker has put up for you.</p>
    <p>The normal port number for W3 servers is port 80, which is such a port. (This number is assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, IANA).</p>
    <p>When you run a server as a test from a non-priviliged account, you will normally test it on other ports, such as 2784 or 5000 typically.</p>

    <h2>Under unix</h2>

    <p>The inet daemon (running as root) can listen for incomming conections on port 80 and pass them down to a process with a safer uid for the server itself. Of course, you have to be root to <a href="installing_basic_httop_daemon.html">set up the inet daemon</a>.</p>

    <h2>Under VMS</h2>

    <p>Under UCX, The process running as a server needs BYPASS privilege to listen to ports below 1024. This might mean you have to install the server. With other TCP/IP packages, privilege of some sort is similarly required.</p>
