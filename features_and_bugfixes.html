    <h1>Features and Bug Fixes</h1>
    <p>The following are features added to the <a href="WWW_user_guide.html" target="_self">WWW app on the NeXT</a> with time, in reverse chronological order. See also the outstanding <a href="buglist_wishlist.html" target="_self">bug list</a> . Credits in brackets are to those who mailed me with the bug reports, to whom thanks.</p>

    <h2>not yet released: 0.14</h2>
    <p>A minor bug fix release.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cmd/N nodes get neater default heading (no slash)</li>
        <li>SGML generated is better: quotes around href,no more numeric ids, header and body tags, NEXTID has N attribute, trivial entities for < and > and & . PRE supported. (Dan Connolly)</li>
        <li>You can edit the title of a document (at last!).</li>
        <li>The Cmd/O panel is merged with the document inspector (Cmd/3). You can link to something by name without loading it.</li>
        <li>You can inspect links.</li>
        <li>Extra blank lines in HTML free-format text are ignored.</li>
        <li>The default port number for HTTP is 80.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1991: version 0.13</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Search panel appears automatically when an index is the main window and disappears otherwise. The panel appears in the top right hand corner to be out of the way of document windows. The Cmd-F key and menu item are unnecessary.</li>
        <li>The "Open from hypertext reference" text is automatically loaded with the address of the main window as a default. This can be picked up and pasted into mail, etc.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Plain text windows don't get distortions in the vertical positioning of scan lines when you scroll them any more.</li>
        <li>Bug fix : Inability to access cs.orst.edu. WWW used the FTP "PASV" command when picking up remote files - some servers (eg cs.orst.edu) don't support this. Now it doesn't - it uses "PORT" instead, which is mandatory for servers. (Ira Fuchs)</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Failed attempts to load remote files now only produce one Alert panel instead of two one after the other. (Ira H Fuchs)</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Loading a newsgroup with no articles in crashed the application. Now it doesn't. Also, title bar "Connecting..." no longer left up once the connection has succeeded. (Ira H. Fuchs )</li>
        <li>Info->Panel is now not editable. (Michael D Mellinger )</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>19 Aug 91 version 0.12</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug fix: .rtf files were loaded as plain text. ( burchard@horizon.math.utah.edu (Paul Burchard) )</li>
        <li>Default.html file shipped with the .app now has absolute references, and so will work on a remote site. (many people!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15 Mar 91 version 0.11</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Feature: If a file is not available locally, or mounted under /Net/hostname/..., the WWW will attempt to pick it up by anonymous FTP giving user@host as password. (Currently the user name given is always "user"!)</li>
        <li>Bug fix: If one didn't have a personal home file, two error messages would be given on startup. Now the system default is loaded without complaint. (Bug introduced at <a href="#version09">version 0.9</a> )</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4 April 91 version 0.10</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug fix: A dummy window created when following a link to a different application would cause crashes if it was resized, or if the link was followed a second time..</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="version09">3 April version 0.9</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug fix: Closing a window which has been edited now prompts for a save as it should. Alert panels have been introduced for some file system, communication and server errors.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: One can now edit files to which one has group access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>26 March 91 version 0.8</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Changed anchor highlighting from dark grey to underline, now underline is available. (I may make underline or colour a user preference or style later.)</li>
        <li>Modified paragraph spacing so that dummy spaces are not introduced between two paragraphs neither or which are "Normal" style. Also, now, the space allowed is the larger of the "space before" the next paragraph and the "space after" the preceding paragraph, rather than the sum. Text is generally more compact.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: A few memory leaks removed with the aid of the excellent MallocDebug utility.</li>
        <li>Feature: When a new file is made, it is given a default title generated from the filename, irrespective of the title of the template.</li>
        <li>Fixed version 2 bug: The last run of a bit of text would have its formating information overwritten by the previous run's format. Bug was in v2 [Text rebewRuns:text:frame:tag] not called any more.</li>
        <li>Fixed version 2 bug: Typing within anchor would produce non-anchor text, breaking the paragraph up when the docuement was saved and reloaded. (Not 100% tested)</li>
        <li>Version 2 enhancements came for free: Spell checking, "Windows" menu, "Services" menu. "File" (was "Window") menu is now renamed "Document". Also, random crashes seem to have disappeared since V2 (touch wood).</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Newly created windows can be edited the moment you have given a filename for them to be stored in: the bug which made them uneditable has been removed.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: No longer crshes when paragraph formatting a selection including the last character.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: The restyling of text can only occur if document is editable. It sets the document "edited".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>19 March 91 Version 0.7</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The annoying vertical fidgeting on loading a new window has been removed.</li>
        <li>" <a href="">Print</a> " and " <a href="">Page layout</a> " menu items have been added. Page layout maintains the "PageType" default in the NXDefaults database, so it is persisent between invokations.</li>
        <li>" <a href="">Help</a> " and " <a href="">Open master template</a> " menu items added.</li>
        <li>"Window" menu renamed "File" to match v2.0 standards.</li>
        <li>" <a href="">Link to File</a> " menu item allows direct link to files of this or any other application. (Not directories).</li>
        <li>Opening remote mounted hypertext files from the workspace now gives them the correct hypertext address, so that links made to them will be correct.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1 Feb 91 Version 0.5</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"New file" and "Link to New" and "Unlink" implemented.</li>
        <li>"Address" style implemented in HTML "ADDRESS" tags.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: Long relative pathnames now treated properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>30 Jan 91 Version 0.4</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save and open panels have reasonable suggested filenames, and correct directories.</li>
        <li>If one creats an anchor the node becomes "edited". One cannot create anchors in unwritable nodes.</li>
        <li>The "editable" status of a file is deduced from its protection, uid, etc.</li>
        <li>The translation between local filenames of remote files and backnow works properly.</li>
        <li>Save in RTF or plaintext format now supported.</li>
        <li>Bug fix: No longer crashes on Cmd/W.</li>
    </ul>
