    <h1>Can't connect to server</h1>

    <p>There is more information you can get. use the "verbose" option on the browser to find out what went wrong:</p>

    <pre>
        www -v http://myhost.domain:80/
    </pre>

    <p>What do you get? A load of trace messages. There are several cases.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The browser can't look up the name of the host. If it can, it will display "Parsed address as" message. If not, try fixing your name server or /etc/hosts file, or quoting the IP number of the host in decimal notation (like 128.141.77.45) instead.
        </li>
        <li><a href="">The browser can get to the host but gets "Connection refused" status back</a> .</li>
        <li>Your browser gets an error number but prints "error message not translated". This is because when it was compiled on your platform it didn't know what form the error message table took. Try the same thing form a unix platform for example.</li>
        <li>You get some network error like "network unreachable". Depending on whether the IP network is your responsibility or not, and your attitude to life, either fix it, try again in an hour's time, or complain to someone.</li>
    </ul>
