    <h1>General Overview</h1>

    <p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.</p>

    <dt><a href="information_by_subject.html">by Subject</a></dt>
    <dd>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</dd>

    <dt><a href="data_sources_classified_by_type_of_service.html">by Type</a></dt>
    <dd>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.</dd>
    
    <p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="index.html">About the W3 project</a>.</p>
