    <h1>What is HyperText</h1>

    <p>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.</p>

    <p>Hypertext is text which contains <a href="hypertextTerms.html" target="_self">links</a> to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a href="">History).</a></p>

    <p>HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="">sound</a>, for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.</p>

    <p>Hypertext and Hypermedia are concepts, not products.</p>
