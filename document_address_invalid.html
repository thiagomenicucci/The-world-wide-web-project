    <h1>Document address invalid</h1>

    <p>You have accessed a W3 server and you get back a message "Document address invalid or access not authorized".</p>

    <p>The server does not (originally for security reasons) distringuish between a document which does not exist, and one to which you are not allowed access. However, most server are public servers which allow access to anyone, so if you are following a bona fide link, this could mean</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You have been passed a bad document address. If you are following a link, check with the author of the document which contained the link.</li>
        <li>The document has been moved. Check with the server administrator. You should be able to find out who runs the server by going to the welcome page (g / with the line mdoe browser) and seeing a link to information about the maintainers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are the server administrator, and you can't understand why the daemon refuses to deliver the file,</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Check the <a href="rule_file.html">rule file</a>.</li>
        <li>Try <a href="">running the daemon with trace from a terminal session</a></li>
    </ul>
